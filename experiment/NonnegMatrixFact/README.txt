Realization the Non Negative Matrix Factorization on 6x50 sounds mixtures.
1st step : dictionary learning
2nd step : modification of the Traffic Perturbator Ratio
3rd step : NMF supervised, smooth and semi-supervised with their own parameters
4th step : metric, RMSE calculation 

% Please have a look at the Config file. It allows you to set the general
% configuration parameters.

% Next, please have a look at the Factors file. It allows you to set the
% specific parameters that need to be set and tested for every
% configurations of your algorithm under evaluation.
