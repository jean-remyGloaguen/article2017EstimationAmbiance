This experience estimates the traffic sound levels of simulated sound mixtures with the help of different versions of NMF. 

To compute theses experiences, download the expLanes tool (https://github.com/mathieulagrange/expLanes)
More information can be found in the documentation of expLanes: https://github.com/mathieulagrange/expLanes/blob/gh-pages/doc/expLanesDocumentation.pdf

Download the sound database (https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/176695#.Wk4eeXkiGos) which contains all the sound mixtures and the audio files useful to build the dictionary and decompress the folder.

Information about the experience or the sound database can be found in:
