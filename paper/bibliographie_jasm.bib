	abstract = {Noise pollution is subjective. Decibel values give a quantification of noise levels. Contour lines with equal noise levels and filled areas of noise classes seem to be useful for citizens and decision makers to oversee the situation. Contour lines and filled areas of noise classes are okay at first glance, but as soon as we do simple analyses a step more in detail, the limitations must be clear. Some aspects: grid size, interpolation techniques, noise levels at façades, counting number of dwellings and citizens, down wind conditions, tunnels and viaducts, the effect of the height of grid points, low flow roads, effect of noise measures, other noise sources. This paper summarizes the state of the art of important noise mapping aspects and gives explanations on limitations and constraints of a noise map.},

	abstract = {Mobile sensors can be interesting in the context of monitoring of noise levels and airborne pollutant concentrations, to obtain measurements over a large zone with one single sensor, and to increase the spatial accuracy of predictions, while avoiding some expensive modelling. Mobile sensors can be combined to classical fixed station, to improve the accuracy and the reliability of predictions. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mobile measurements should be processed to obtain reliable estimations in spite of the strong variability of the data collected. Mobile measurements have been collected on a bicycle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), in an area of Gent (Belgium). The 1s-sound pressure levels and 1s-black carbon concentrations evolutions were measured. In addition, 5 continuous monitoring fixed stations were placed at building facades. Different processing methods are compared, based on different temporal and spatial weighting aggregations. The possibility to take profit of the fixed stations to refine estimations is tested, according to the noise levels collected at fixed stations and the distance between mobile and fixed sensors. Finally, the operational conditions required to obtain reliable estimations based on mobile measures are discussed.},

To make the system robust to various types of sound sources, we designed a tree of reference sound models for classification, in which especially generated total three of GMMs for external sounds according to different characteristics of frequency distributions. The performance of the proposed system, evaluated in terms of percent classification, indicated an averaged accuracy of 91.36\% for off-line test.

The feasibility of this approach will be proved implementing the system in two pilot areas with different territorial and environmental characteristics: an agglomeration and a major road. The first pilot area will be located in Milan, in a significant portion of the town, while the second one will be situated along the motorway A90 surrounding the city of Rome. The two pilot areas show peculiar needs and characteristics, such as the presence of multiple noise sources, roads junctions, traffic and weather conditions, that require a different system’s implementation approach. In this paper the main issues related to the design of the system configuration in the pilot area of Rome are described.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.apacoust.2015.08.005},
	abstract = {Since the introduction of the Environmental Noise Directive, strategic noise mapping has been used as a tool for noise policy in many European countries. Although these strategic noise maps have their merits, they also have some shortcomings: accuracy in predicted noise levels in shielded or quiet areas is not very high, the maps fail to capture sounds that are less easy to predict, and above all the dynamics of the sound environment are not included. However, these dynamics might be important to evaluate sleep disturbance and noise annoyance. In this paper, a model to dynamically (every 15min) update a noise map based on measurements is proposed. This model relies on reasonable good source and propagation models and a not-very-dense measurement network. The least mean squares method (LMS) is used for tuning model parameters. To avoid an under-determined system, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced by grouping the sources and propagation paths into different categories. Source strengths and propagation path attenuations in the same category are corrected by offsetting the same small values from their base levels. The map-based interpolation is performed jointly on LAeq,L10 and L90, and takes into account 1/3-octave band spectra. The efficiency of the proposed method was validated in a case study in the Katendrecht district of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The results showed that more than 75\% of the LAeq predictions are closer to the measurement than the ab initio calculations based on traffic data. Values for L10 and L90 are closer to measurements for 55\% and 90\% of the observations, respectively.},

In total this included one agglomeration, one airport and approximately 600 km of major roads outside the agglomeration. These noise maps describe the level of noise exposure of approximately 1.25 million people. The first phase of noise mapping was dealt with by five noise mapping bodies while 26 action planning authorities were involved in the development of the associated action plans. The second phase of noise mapping, due to be completed in 2012, sees a reduction in the defined thresholds describing the required agglomerations, roads and railways that have to be mapped. This will have a significant impact on the extent of mapping required. In Ireland this will result in an increased number of local authorities being required to develop strategic noise maps for their area along with the further development of associated action plans. It is appropriate at this point to review the work process and results from the first phase of noise mapping in Ireland in order to establish areas that could be improved, throughout the noise mapping project. In this paper a review of the implementation procedures focussing on (dominant) road traffic noise is presented. It is identified that more standardisation is needed and this could be achieved by the establishment of a national expert steering group.},

	abstract = {This letter presents theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental results about nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence. We describe how IS-NMF is underlaid by a well-defined statistical model of superimposed gaussian components and is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of variance parameters. This setting can accommodate regularization constraints on the factors through Bayesian priors. In particular, inverse-gamma and gamma Markov chain priors are considered in this work. Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed. We also discuss the links between the IS divergence and other cost functions used in NMF, in particular, the Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As such, we describe how IS-NMF can also be performed using a gradient multiplicative algorithm (a standard algorithm structure in NMF) whose convergence is observed in practice, though not proven. Finally, we report a furnished experimental comparative study of Euclidean-NMF, KL-NMF, and IS-NMF algorithms applied to the power spectrogram of a short piano sequence recorded in real conditions, with various initializations and model orders. Then we show how IS-NMF can successfully be employed for denoising and upmix (mono to stereo conversion) of an original piece of early jazz music. These experiments indicate that IS-NMF correctly captures the semantics of audio and is better suited to the representation of music signals than NMF with the usual Euclidean and KL costs.},

	abstract = {The independent component analysis (ICA) of a random vector consists of searching for a linear transformation that minimizes the statistical dependence between its components. In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.
Résumé
L'Analyse en Composantes Indépendentes (ICA) d'un vecteur aléatoire consiste en la recherche d'une transformation linéaire qui minimise la dépendance statistique entre ses composantes. Afin de définir des critères d'optimisation appropriés, on utilise un développment en série de l'information mutuelle en fonction de cumulants d'ordre croissant. On propose ensuite un algorithme pratique permettant le calcul de l'ICA d'une matrice de données en un temps polynomial. Le concept d'ICA peut être vu en réalité comme une extention de l'Analyse en Composantes Principales (PCA) qui, elle, ne peut imposer l'indépendence qu'au second ordre et définit par conséquent des directions orthogonales. Les applications potentielles de l'ICA incluent l'analyse et la compression de données, la détection bayesienne, la localisation de sources, et l'identification et la déconvolution aveugles.},

	abstract = {An unsupervised learning algorithm for the separation of sound sources in one-channel music signals is presented. The algorithm is based on factorizing the magnitude spectrogram of an input signal into a sum of components, each of which has a fixed magnitude spectrum and a time-varying gain. Each sound source, in turn, is modeled as a sum of one or more components. The parameters of the components are estimated by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input spectrogram and the model, while restricting the component spectrograms to be nonnegative and favoring components whose gains are slowly varying and sparse. Temporal continuity is favored by using a cost term which is the sum of squared differences between the gains in adjacent frames, and sparseness is favored by penalizing nonzero gains. The proposed iterative estimation algorithm is initialized with random values, and the gains and the spectra are then alternatively updated using multiplicative update rules until the values converge. Simulation experiments were carried out using generated mixtures of pitched musical instrument samples and drum sounds. The performance of the proposed method was compared with independent subspace analysis and basic nonnegative matrix factorization, which are based on the same linear model. According to these simulations, the proposed method enables a better separation quality than the previous algorithms. Especially, the temporal continuity criterion improved the detection of pitched musical sounds. The sparseness criterion did not produce significant improvements},

Si la transcription de musique monodique est aujourd'hui bien maîtrisée, le cas de la musique polyphonique est en revanche un problème largement ouvert. Les décompositions de matrices en valeurs propres et en valeurs singulières sont des techniques classiques d'algèbre linéaire utilisées dans un grand nombre d'applications de traitement du signal. Elles permettent de représenter efficacement les données observées en utilisant un nombre limité d'atomes élémentaires. Contrairement à d'autres techniques de représentations du signal, ces atomes ne sont pas recherchés au sein d'un dictionnaire pré-défini, mais sont extraits des données elles-mêmes. La factorisation en matrices non-négatives (NMF) est une technique analogue d'algèbre linéaire, qui réduit le rang tout en fournissant des atomes à valeurs exclusivement positives, plus facilement interprétables. Elle fournit conjointement un dictionnaire extrait des données et la décomposition de ces mêmes données dans ce dictionnaire. Ce mémoire est consacré à l'étude théorique et expérimentale détaillée de ces méthodes. Il poursuit plusieurs objectifs : l'amélioration des performances des systèmes de transcription qui les utilisent, de la pertinence sémantique des représentations mi-niveau produites, et du contrôle des propriétés théoriques et pratiques des algorithmes existants et originaux mis en œuvre au cours de la thèse.},

	abstract = {Intrinsic variability due to micrometeorological effects and/or ground effects, measurement uncertainty and model uncertainty are the main sources of spreading of the parameters influencing outdoor sound propagation. Thus spreading associated to outdoor SPL is a complex combination of deterministic, stochastic and epistemic uncertainties, and can be quantified thanks to a probabilistic process. This statistical process is presented in this paper and is called Calibration Under Uncertainty (CUU). Quantitative uncertainty assessment involves a pre-existing physical system to be studied, input data which can be measured or derived from measurements, and a sufficient amount of available (experimental and/or numerical) data with an eventual human expertise. CUU couples information from experimental and modelled data taking into account their own uncertainties (measurements errors, lack of knowledge on physical behavior, etc.)under specific assumptions. Quantify the global uncertainty on SPL, rank or apportion the contributions of influent parameters to a given output quantity of interest, compare experimental and effective parameters, and more generally understand the whole input-output structure are the main tasks of such a statistical method. CUU process has been applied to more or less complex cases using a large experimental set of data (Lannemezan 2005 (F)). An application to near ground sound propagation has been first led to understand the relative influence of ground parameters. A more complex case considering large distances and including micrometeorological effects has also been fulfilled with promising results which are presented in this paper.},

A variety of features have been proposed for audio recognition, including the popular Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) which describe the audio spectral shape. Environmental sounds, such as chirpings of insects and sounds of rain which are typically noise-like with a broad flat spectrum, may include strong temporal domain signatures. However, only few temporal-domain features have been developed to characterize such diverse audio signals previously. Here, we perform an empirical feature analysis for audio environment characterization and propose to use the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to obtain effective time-frequency features. The MP-based method utilizes a dictionary of atoms for feature selection, resulting in a flexible, intuitive and physically interpretable set of features. The MP-based feature is adopted to supplement the MFCC features to yield higher recognition accuracy for environmental sounds. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of these joint features for unstructured environmental sound classification, including listening tests to study human recognition capabilities. Our recognition system has shown to produce comparable performance as human listeners.},

	abstract = {One of the main aspects affecting the quality of life of people living in urban and suburban areas is their continued exposure to high Road Traffic Noise (RTN) levels. Until now, noise measurements in cities have been performed by professionals, recording data in certain locations to build a noise map afterwards. However, the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) has enabled automatic noise mapping in smart cities. In order to obtain a reliable picture of the RTN levels affecting citizens, Anomalous Noise Events (ANE) unrelated to road traffic should be removed from the noise map computation. To this aim, this paper introduces an Anomalous Noise Event Detector (ANED) designed to differentiate between RTN and ANE in real time within a predefined interval running on the distributed low-cost acoustic sensors of a WASN. The proposed ANED follows a two-class audio event detection and classification approach, instead of multi-class or one-class classification schemes, taking advantage of the collection of representative acoustic data in real-life environments. The experiments conducted within the DYNAMAP project, implemented on ARM-based acoustic sensors, show the feasibility of the proposal both in terms of computational cost and classification performance using standard Mel cepstral coefficients and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The two-class GMM core classifier relatively improves the baseline universal GMM one-class classifier F1 measure by 18.7\% and 31.8\% for suburban and urban environments, respectively, within the 1-s integration interval. Nevertheless, according to the results, the classification performance of the current ANED implementation still has room for improvement.},

Conventional SNMF often degrades the separation performance owing to the basis-sharing problem. Our penalized SNMF forces nontarget bases to become different from the target bases, which increases the separated sound quality.},
